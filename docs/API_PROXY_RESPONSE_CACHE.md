# API Proxy Response Cache, Request Coalescing & Stream Fan-out

Design + phased implementation plan for serving identical proxy requests from a
saved response instead of hitting the upstream, collapsing concurrent duplicates
onto a single in-flight request, and fanning one live stream out to several
clients. Driven by RAG + arena workloads where distinct pipelines share
identical sub-steps (e.g. the same question-reformulation or the same
embedding/rerank against the same model).

Cross-references: `docs/API_PROXY_PIPELINES.md` (node graph), `docs/API_PROXY_FOUNDATION.md`
(request flow), `docs/ANTHROPIC_OPENAI_BRIDGE.md` (translation + attribution),
`docs/RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT.md` (lease/eviction).

## Goal & scope

- Opt-in, node-placed caching — never global/automatic. The operator inserts a
  `cache` node only where reuse is intended.
- First-class support for embeddings and rerank (deterministic, non-streaming,
  single JSON body) — the highest-value, lowest-risk slice.
- Then chat completions (streaming + non-streaming), including coalescing of
  concurrent duplicates and replay-buffered fan-out of a live stream.
- Decouple Claude Code attribution sanitization from translation into its own
  placeable `strip-attribution` node, so a clean cache key (and KV-prefix
  stability) is composed explicitly where needed.

Non-goals (v1): cross-process/shared cache, semantic/fuzzy matching, caching
upstream error bodies, caching fusion-node direct responses.

## Established architecture facts (verified)

- All protocol endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`,
  `/v1/rerank`, …) share one path: `proxyProtocolEndpoint` →
  `resolveApiProxyRouteChain` (pure pre-pass) → gateway → domain lease →
  `serveResolvedTarget` → forwarder. A pipeline node therefore works uniformly
  across all of them.
- The route chain is a pure pre-pass: `resolveApiProxyRouteChain`
  (`apps/api/src/proxy/pipeline.ts`) walks the node graph mutating
  `state.request` and returns `ApiProxyRouteChainResult` with
  `kind: target | endpoint | fusion | error`. **No node can currently return a
  response.** `fusion` is the precedent for an early terminal kind handled
  specially before gateway/lease.
- Response capture already exists (`createApiProxyResponseCaptureSink`,
  `apps/api/src/proxy/response-capture.ts`): for non-streaming it takes the
  client-final text (`setText`), for streaming it tees via a passthrough
  `TransformStream` (`tap`) and accumulates the client-final bytes
  (post-translation). This is exactly the accumulation a cache write needs.
- Embeddings/rerank are non-streaming, single JSON, deterministic — read whole
  via `upstream.text()`; metered by `usageFromNonStreamBody`
  (`apps/api/src/proxy/usage-meter.ts`).
- Claude Code attribution sanitization (`sanitizeClaudeCodeAttribution`,
  `apps/api/src/proxy/attribution.ts`) is currently invoked **only** inside
  `translateAnthropicForwardBody` (`apps/api/src/proxy/translation.ts`) at
  forward time, gated on `translateAnthropic` (inbound Anthropic →
  non-anthropic upstream). It does not run for OpenAI-native inbound, nor for
  anthropic→anthropic passthrough, and runs **after** the pipeline — so a
  mid-pipeline cache node would otherwise key over volatile `cch` noise.

## Design decisions (the contract)

1. **Key over body-at-node-entry.** The cache key is computed from
   `state.request.body` as it exists when the walk enters the `cache` node —
   i.e. reflecting all preceding nodes, ignoring any subsequent transforms.
   This is free: it is exactly the body the pre-pass already holds.
2. **Sanitization is a node, placed manually.** `strip-attribution` cleans the
   `cch`/billing attribution. To get a clean key, place it before `cache`
   (`strip-attribution → cache → target`). Removing the hardcoded call from
   translation means sanitization is **no longer automatic** — chosen
   deliberately (manual variant). Requests with a direct `routeTo` (no pipeline)
   or pipelines without the node simply are not sanitized.
3. **Determinism is the operator's call.** The key hashes the full canonical
   body including sampling params. Same params (even `temperature>0`) ⇒ same
   key ⇒ shared result is accepted by fiat (placement = consent). Different
   `temperature`/`seed`/etc. ⇒ different key automatically. Arena never routes
   the same prompt to the same model, so no special handling.
4. **Three states of a key**, unified by the `cache` node:
   - `cold` (miss) → forward, become owner, fill cache, fan-out.
   - `hot` (in-flight) → coalesce: subscribe to the owner's live result.
   - `warm` (stored) → replay from store.
5. **A hit short-circuits before gateway/lease.** No autostart, no model load,
   no domain lease, no forward. This is the main win for RAG.

## Cache key specification

```
key = sha256( namespace ‖ modelId ‖ canonicalJson(body \ volatile) )
```

- `namespace` — optional `cache` node config field; disambiguates when one
  public model id is conditionally routed to different upstreams.
- `modelId` — `resolution.request.modelId` (public model name; known at node
  entry). Distinct models never collide.
- `body \ volatile` — strip `stream` and `stream_options` (streaming preference
  must not split the entry), keep everything else (messages/input/query/
  documents, temperature, top_p, top_k, seed, max_tokens, tools, …).
- `canonicalJson` — stable key ordering so equal bodies hash equal.
- The body is already attribution-clean **iff** a `strip-attribution` node ran
  earlier; otherwise volatile `cch` hashes churn the key (operator's
  responsibility, documented at the node).

## Components

### `strip-attribution` node (PR1)

- Core schema: add `ApiProxyStripAttributionConfigSchema` (v1 may be empty or
  two toggles: strip billing line / pin `cch`→0, both default on) and a variant
  in the `ApiProxyPipelineNodeSchema` discriminated union
  (`packages/core/src/index.ts`), `ports: { next }`.
- Handler in `pipeline.ts` mirrors `replace-text`: run
  `sanitizeClaudeCodeAttribution`, replace `state.request.body` if changed,
  invalidate the local token estimate, push a `routeTrace` step, follow `next`.
- Logic stays in `apps/api/src/proxy/attribution.ts`. (Optional: move the pure
  fn to core later if the web block-editor wants a live preview.)
- Remove the `sanitizeClaudeCodeAttribution` call from
  `translateAnthropicForwardBody` — translation becomes pure protocol
  translation. The sanitizer is Anthropic-body-shaped and the pipeline body is
  in the client protocol (Anthropic for CC, pre-translation), so node placement
  anywhere upstream of the target is structurally correct.
- Validation (`pipeline-validation.ts`) + web palette/config form
  (`apps/web/src/ui/proxy/canvas/`). Net observability gain: sanitization now
  shows in `routeTrace`/route-explain instead of being silent.

### `cache` node + `kind:"response"` short-circuit (PR2 — Phase 1)

- Core schema: `ApiProxyCacheConfigSchema` (`ttlSeconds`, optional `namespace`,
  optional explicit key-field selection) + union variant. Ports: `{ hit, miss }`
  (or single `miss`/`next` with implicit hit terminal).
- New terminal in `ApiProxyRouteChainResult`:
  `{ ok:true, kind:"response", request, response: {...}, routeTrace }`.
- `case "cache"` in `resolveApiProxyRouteChain`:
  - compute key; look up store.
  - warm → return `kind:"response"` with the stored body/content-type/is-sse.
  - cold/hot → push a "cache-write" target into `state` (parallel to
    `responseCaptures`) carrying the key + ttl, follow `miss`.
- `proxyProtocolEndpointInner` (`protocol-endpoint.ts`): after route resolution
  (~`:288`), before the gateway (~`:688`), handle `kind:"response"` exactly like
  `fusion` is handled early — build a `Response` from the stored bytes, mark the
  trace, return. Skips gateway/lease/readiness/forward entirely.
- Write path: extend the response-capture sink (or a sibling sink) so the
  accumulated client-final body is written to the cache store under the key on
  completion (reuses `setText` for non-stream; `tap` accumulation already
  present for stream). Phase 1 wires non-streaming only (embeddings, rerank,
  non-stream chat).
- Downstream consumers of the route result (`fusion.ts`, `gateway.ts`,
  `route-explain`) must tolerate/short-circuit the new kind.

### Cache store (PR2)

- New SQLite table `proxy_response_cache` declared in both `db/schema.ts`
  (Drizzle) and `db/index.ts:migrate()` (idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
  EXISTS`): `key PRIMARY KEY, model_id, content_type, is_sse, body BLOB,
  size_bytes, created_at, expires_at, last_access_at, hit_count`.
- Rebuildable cache (fits the DB's "runtime state + rebuildable caches" role,
  like `model_cache`). Eviction: per-entry TTL (`expires_at`) + global
  size-bounded LRU (`last_access_at`, cap from config/env). Embedding vectors
  are large → size cap is mandatory.
- Module `apps/api/src/proxy/response-cache.ts`: `get(key)`, `put(...)`,
  `evict()`, plus a clear/list admin op for the UI.

### Coalescing / single-flight (PR3)

- In-memory `Map<key, InFlight>` keyed by the same cache key.
- Non-streaming: a `hot` hit `await`s the owner's settled bytes (a shared
  promise) instead of forwarding. Subscribers skip the domain lease and
  readiness (they do no compute) and are metered as `coalesced`.
- Owner lifetime: drive the upstream to completion independent of the
  originating client's abort, so the cache fills and subscribers survive
  (behavior change — documented).

### Stream fan-out (PR4 — the heavy one)

- `Broadcaster` wrapping the single upstream SSE stream at the `tap` point:
  `chunks: Uint8Array[]` replay buffer + `Set<subscriber>` + done/error state.
- Late joiner: a `ReadableStream` that first drains the buffer, then receives
  live chunks, then closes on upstream end. Per-subscriber queues so a slow
  client never stalls the owner or peers (drop/disconnect a hopeless laggard).
- Re-framing: handle stream/non-stream mismatch between the stored/owner stream
  and a joining client's preference (sse → concatenated final JSON, json →
  single-shot sse).
- Telemetry: only the owner is metered; subscribers `coalesced`. Errors
  mid-stream propagate to all subscribers.

### Telemetry, traces, UI (folded across PRs)

- `ApiProxyRequestTrace` gains a cache marker (`hit` | `coalesced` | `store` |
  `miss`); `proxy/stats.ts` counts hit rate. No double-counting of usage.
- Web: `cache` + `strip-attribution` nodes in the canvas palette + config
  panels; a cache admin view (list/clear) via a new `/api/proxy/cache` route and
  `apps/web/src/api/client.ts`.

### PR2 implementation notes (as built)

- Cache node uses a single `next` port (= the miss/cold path); a hit is an
  implicit terminal that returns `kind:"response"`. No separate `hit` port.
- The route-chain gains injected `lookupCache` (provided by the protocol
  endpoint; `route-explain` and `fusion` omit it, so the node always misses in
  dry-run / fusion branches). The handler computes the key from the body at the
  node's position and stores it in `state.cacheWrites` on a miss.
- Writes are committed by `createApiProxyResponseCaptureSink` on flush, only for
  non-stream (`setText`) bodies that are not error-shaped; content-type stored
  as `application/json`, status `200`.
- Streaming requests skip the node entirely in this phase (PR4 adds fan-out).

### PR3 implementation notes (as built)

- In-flight registry `response-coalesce.ts`: `register/find/settle` over a
  `Map<key, deferred>`. The cache node, after a store miss, checks for an
  in-flight owner: present ⇒ `await` it (`kind:"response"`, `source:"coalesced"`,
  waiters do no compute and skip the lease since routing short-circuits);
  absent ⇒ register as owner and continue to the target.
- Settlement is driven by the response-capture sink on flush: each cache-write
  key is settled with the stored payload (success) or `null` (error/no body) —
  this releases waiters and removes the map entry, so an owner always settles
  its own key. The `kind:"response"` endpoint path also settles any owner keys
  it carries (owner-then-downstream-hit). A 120s timeout in `findInFlight` is the
  backstop for exotic never-settle paths (e.g. route resolution failing after
  the owner registered); a timed-out waiter falls back to forwarding and cleans
  the leaked entry.
- On owner failure, waiters resolve to `null` and fall through to a plain miss
  (forward + their own cache write), so a failed owner never poisons the herd.
- **Not yet done:** owner-lifetime decoupling from the originating client. If the
  owner's client aborts, its upstream is aborted too (no cache write ⇒ waiters
  fall back). Driving the owner to completion independent of its client is
  deferred (rides on the PR4 streaming work).

### PR4 implementation notes (as built)

Streaming requests now participate in the cache node (they were skipped in PR2).

- **Framing-matched, no re-framing.** One store slot per key (stream still
  excluded from the key), but a read only hits when the entry's framing matches
  the client: a stream client hits an `isSse` entry, a non-stream client hits a
  non-SSE entry; a mismatch is treated as a miss and re-generates (last writer
  wins the framing). Consistent per-pipeline usage never thrashes; this avoids
  all SSE↔JSON re-framing code.
- **Broadcaster** (`response-broadcast.ts`): per-key chunk buffer + subscriber
  set. A stream miss registers a broadcast (owner); a concurrent stream request
  subscribes (`source:"coalesced"`, `kind:"response"` with a `ReadableStream`
  body = replay buffer + live tail). The route-chain `response` body is now
  `string | ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`.
- **Two serve paths, two fan-out modes** (chosen: full live fan-out, owner
  outlives client):
  - Live `respond()` path (non-preemptible managed, external, translated):
    `finishStreamResponse` subscribes the owner's own client to the broadcast
    and **pumps** the metered stream to completion in the background
    (`drainApiProxyStream`), decoupled from the client. The capture sink's `tap`
    feeds the broadcast per chunk and stores the accumulated SSE on flush. If the
    owner's client disconnects, the pump still finishes → subscribers + cache are
    complete. ✅ option A fully honored here.
  - Buffered resumable path (preemptible managed chat): the response is built
    all-at-once, so it does **completed fan-out** — on success it stores the
    final SSE, pushes it to the broadcast as one chunk, and finishes; subscribers
    that were waiting get the whole result. **Limitation:** this path is *not*
    decoupled — if the owner's client aborts mid-generation the upstream aborts,
    no cache write, and the broadcast finishes empty (subscribers get nothing).
    Managed-chat streaming via resumable is already buffered (the client gets the
    reply at the end), so this only affects the rare owner-abort case.
- **No broadcast leak:** the sink finishes the broadcast for every cache-write
  key on flush (both branches), and the resumable path finishes explicitly on
  success/abort, so subscribers never hang regardless of serve path.
- **Telemetry:** subscribers report `trace.cache:"coalesced"`; only the owner is
  metered (subscription bodies skip `usageFromNonStreamBody`).
- **Not unit-tested:** the live pump + client-disconnect integration (hard to
  exercise without a real streaming upstream). The broadcaster, the streaming
  cache-node routing, and the sink's SSE store/feed/finish are unit-tested;
  recommend a manual live verification of multi-client fan-out + disconnect.

### PR5 implementation notes (as built)

- Ops endpoints: `GET /api/proxy/cache` → `{ entries, totalBytes }`,
  `DELETE /api/proxy/cache` → clears the store (`apiProxyResponseCacheStats` /
  `clearApiProxyResponseCache`).
- Stats: `ApiProxyStatsTotals`/`ApiProxyStatsModelEntry` gain `cacheHits` (counts
  traces with `trace.cache` ∈ {`hit`,`coalesced`} — i.e. requests served without
  an upstream call; `store` is a forward-that-cached, not a hit). Surfaced in the
  proxy Statistics section (totals block + per-hour column + a per-request
  `cache` badge) alongside a Response-cache card (entries/size + Clear).

## Status: all five PRs landed

The feature is complete per this plan. Remaining backlog (not scheduled):
owner-lifetime decoupling for the buffered resumable path; bounded per-subscriber
queues / laggard disconnect; a target "generation" component in the key for
invalidation on model/binary/args change; optional SSE↔JSON re-framing to let
stream and non-stream requests share one entry.

## Risks & future

- **Invalidation:** stale entries when the underlying model/binary/args change.
  v1 relies on TTL + manual clear; later add a target "generation" component to
  the key.
- **Forgotten sanitization:** manual `strip-attribution` placement means CC
  traffic without the node loses KV-prefix stability and cache-key cleanliness —
  accepted trade for placement control.
- **Stream fan-out backpressure:** unbounded replay buffers vs. slow
  subscribers; bound memory and disconnect laggards.
- **Future:** persistent/shared cache across restarts already holds (SQLite);
  cross-process or multi-node sharing is out of scope; semantic caching is a
  separate effort.
