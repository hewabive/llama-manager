# API Proxy Pipelines: node-graph routing

A pipeline is a named graph of nodes that transforms a request and decides which
target receives it. Pipelines are the proxy's "ersatz programming" surface:
conditions branch, calls reuse shared sub-graphs, and every resolution is
recorded step by step. Loops are deliberately impossible.

Source map:

- `packages/core/src/index.ts` — `ApiProxyPipelineConfigSchema`,
  `ApiProxyPipelineNodeSchema`, `ApiProxyConditionPredicateSchema`,
  `ApiProxyPortRefSchema`, legacy upgrade (`upgradeLegacyApiProxyPipeline`),
  shared graph helpers (`apiProxyPipelineNodePorts`,
  `collectApiProxyPipelineExitNames`).
- `apps/api/src/proxy/pipeline.ts` — the resolver (`resolveApiProxyRouteChain`).
- `apps/api/src/proxy/condition.ts` — predicate evaluation.
- `apps/api/src/proxy/token-estimate.ts` — local token estimator.
- `apps/api/src/proxy/request-text.ts` — request text extraction (scopes).
- `apps/api/src/proxy/pipeline-validation.ts` — save-time graph validation.
- `apps/api/src/proxy/route-explain.ts` — dry-run explain endpoint.

## Data model

```jsonc
{
  "id": "…",
  "name": "route-by-size",
  "enabled": true,
  "entry": { "type": "node", "id": "cond" },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "cond",
      "name": "size?",
      "type": "condition",
      "config": {
        "predicate": { "type": "token-estimate", "minTokens": 8000 },
      },
      "ports": {
        "true": { "type": "target", "id": "<background-target>" },
        "false": { "type": "pipeline", "id": "<chat-pipeline>" },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

A **port ref** points at one of three things:

- `node` — another node in the _same_ pipeline;
- `target` — a proxy target; the walk terminates and the request is forwarded;
- `pipeline` — a **jump** to another pipeline's `entry` (tail-call: the call
  stack is unchanged).

`entry` is itself a port ref (a pipeline whose entry points straight at a
target is a pure alias). `null` anywhere means "unwired" and produces a
`route_unbound` diagnostic if the walk reaches it.

## Node types

| type              | config                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ports                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `replace-text`    | `rules: [{enabled, find, replace}]` — literal substring rules over decoded string values of the parsed body (stored text is matched as-is, no escape interpretation; the routing `model` field is never rewritten). The web editor offers a display toggle that shows/accepts rules in `\n`-escaped form and converts to literal text before saving. | `next`                        |
| `capture-request` | — (no options)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `next`                        |

### Edit-request operations

Structural edits of the parsed body, applied in order by
`applyApiProxyRequestEdits` (`@llama-manager/core` — shared by the runtime
walker and the web editor's live preview, one implementation):

- `remove-tool {toolName}` — drops every entry of the top-level `tools` array
  whose name matches. `*` in `toolName` matches any character run
  (`mcp__*`); otherwise the match is exact. Tool names are read from both
  protocol shapes (`tool.function.name` for OpenAI, `tool.name` for
  Anthropic). When `tools` ends up empty the key is deleted; an object
  `tool_choice` naming a removed tool is deleted too.
- `replace-tool {toolName, value}` — replaces every matching entry with
  `value` (a full tool JSON object).
- `add-tool {value}` — appends `value` to `tools`, creating the array.
- `set-field {path, value}` — sets any body field to `value` (any JSON value).
  `path` is dot-separated keys with `[n]` array indices (`max_tokens`,
  `stream_options.include_usage`, `messages[0].role`); paths are validated at
  save time. Missing intermediate **objects** are created; array indices must
  address an existing element (the final segment may also be `[length]` to
  append). A path that runs through a scalar or mismatched container reports a
  no-match outcome instead of overwriting. The write is copy-on-write along
  the path — the pre-edit body (e.g. an earlier `capture-request`) is never
  mutated.
- `remove-field {path}` — deletes the field (object key or array element,
  spliced) at `path`; absent paths report `<path> is not present`.

Every operation reports an outcome (`removed 2 tool(s): a, b` /
`set max_tokens = 512 (was 16384)` / `no tool matches "x"`) joined into the
node's `routeTrace` detail, so a
non-matching rule is visible in the test bench and request traces instead of
failing silently. The web editor's **block editor** modal previews operations
against a pasted sample request: sample tools render as blocks with
removed/replaced badges, and Remove/Replace/Add buttons on the blocks generate
operations.

### Reasoning control

The `reasoning` node sets the request fields that toggle and budget the model's
thinking/reasoning channel. `effort` mirrors the llama.cpp web UI presets
(`off` disables thinking; `low`/`medium`/`high` = 512/2048/8192 token budgets;
`max` = unlimited; `custom` uses `customBudgetTokens`, `-1` = unlimited). The
node synthesizes `set-field` operations via
`apiProxyReasoningEditOperations(config, protocol)` (`@llama-manager/core`,
shared with the editor's live preview) and runs them through
`applyApiProxyRequestEdits`, so the written shape follows the **inbound
protocol**:

- OpenAI → `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` (bool) and, when a finite
  budget is set, `thinking_budget_tokens` (llama.cpp extensions; `max`/`-1`
  omit the budget and defer to the server default).
- Anthropic → the native `thinking: {type: "enabled"|"disabled", budget_tokens}`
  block. For Anthropic-profile upstreams it passes through verbatim; for
  non-anthropic upstreams the `anthropic-openai-bridge` translates it — enabled
  → `thinking_budget_tokens`, and disabled → `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking:false`
  (via the consumer-set `enableThinkingKwargField` option) so "off" reaches
  llama.cpp.

The node does not arm llama.cpp's realtime `reasoning_control`/force-answer
endpoint — that is the separate interrupt-to-force-answer path on proxy
targets.

### Condition predicates

- `text-match` — substring or regex (`regex: true`, validated at save time;
  case-insensitive unless `caseSensitive`) over a **scope**:
  `last-user-message`, `any-message`, `system` (OpenAI `system`/`developer`
  roles and the Anthropic top-level `system` field), or `full-body`
  (serialized JSON). Conditions see the request **after** any `replace-text`
  nodes earlier on the route — normalize first, then match.
- `token-estimate` — true when the estimated request size ≥ `minTokens`.
- `source` — true when the request's resolved source id (see `proxy/sources.ts`)
  equals `sourceId`; `null` matches anonymous requests.

### Token estimation is local by design

Resolution runs as a pure pre-pass before the gateway decision and lease
acquisition (`protocol-endpoint.ts`), so a condition may not depend on live
GPU state — asking a managed `llama-server` to `/tokenize` could require
starting it, which is the scheduler's job and would invert the layering (and
invite pathological swaps: load model A to count tokens for a request that
then routes to B). Instead `token-estimate.ts` estimates from text alone with
per-codepoint weights (tokens per character):

- whitespace and ASCII alphanumerics: 0.25 (≈4 chars/token)
- other ASCII: 0.4
- Cyrillic (U+0400–U+04FF): 0.45 (≈2.2 chars/token)
- CJK ranges: 1.0
- everything else: 0.5

Counted text: all message contents (string or text parts), Anthropic `system`,
completion `prompt`, plus serialized `tools`; +4 tokens per message; if the
body has no messages at all, the serialized body. Accuracy vs a real llama
tokenizer is ±10–20%, which is fine for routing thresholds — the UI labels the
field "estimated". The estimate is memoized per resolution and invalidated
when a `replace-text` node changes the body.

## Functions: call and exit

A pipeline **is** a function: `entry` is its head, `exit` nodes are named
return points. A `call` node runs another pipeline; when the walk hits an
`exit` node, the innermost call frame pops and continues at the call node's
port named by `exitName`. This means:

- a `target` inside a callee terminates the route — the request goes to the
  model without "returning" (resolution computes a path, not a value);
- exits give the callee a way to _return a decision_ — wire different exit
  names to different continuations at each call site;
- a `pipeline`-type port ref is a tail jump: it does not push a frame, so an
  exit inside the jumped-to pipeline returns to the original caller. Reachable
  exit names for validation are collected across the jump closure
  (`collectApiProxyPipelineExitNames`);
- an `exit` with an empty call stack is a `route_invalid` diagnostic;
  an exit name with no wired port on the call node is `route_unbound`.

## No loops

- Within a graph, `node`-type port edges must form a DAG (checked at save).
- A pipeline must not reference itself through any jump/call chain (checked at
  save over the cross-pipeline reference closure).
- Runtime backstops (file edits bypass API validation until restart): max 256
  visited nodes per resolution, call depth ≤ 8, recursion guard on the call
  stack — all surface as `pipeline_cycle` diagnostics.

## Capture semantics

`capture-request` writes a file **at the moment the walk passes the node**,
containing exactly the request body as it arrived there — changes made by
earlier nodes are included, later changes are not. Each capture node visit
writes its own file.

All files saved for one proxied request share a per-request directory
`data/proxy-requests/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<timestamp>-<traceId>/`, named
`<NN>-<node-kind>.json` in visit order; future nodes that persist other
per-request artifacts write into the same directory. Each file is an
`ApiProxyRequestFileRecord` envelope (`traceId`, `kind`, node `label`,
protocol/endpoint/model context, `data` payload). The saving side appends
file metadata (`ApiProxyTraceFile`: name, root-relative path, kind, label,
bytes) to `trace.files`, which the Recent requests table renders as a Files
button — pick a file from its menu to view the content, fetched via
`GET /api/proxy/request-file?path=<relative path>` (admin, path-confined to
`data/proxy-requests/`).

## Observability

- Every resolution appends `routeTrace` to the request trace
  (`ApiProxyRequestTraceSchema`): entered pipelines, visited nodes, chosen
  ports and details (condition outcomes include the measured estimate, e.g.
  `~7212 tokens < 8000`). The proxy view's Recent requests table shows it as a
  hoverable step list.
- `POST /api/proxy/route-explain` (admin) dry-runs resolution without
  forwarding, capture or stats: body `{protocol, body, sourceId?}` →
  `{ok, targetId, targetName, diagnostic, routeTrace, textReplacementCount,
tokenEstimate, transformedBody}`. Capture nodes do not write logs in explain
  mode.

## Web UI split

Two pages share the proxy domain. `#/proxy` (Proxy) is operations: target
runtime with inflight/prefill progress, scheduler plan check, stats and the
recent-request traces. `#/routing` (Routing) is construction: the topology map
(what each model can reach, dangling refs, unreachable pipelines), the
model/pipeline/target tables, a full-page pipeline editor addressed as
`#/routing/<pipelineId>` (`#/routing/new` to create), and the route test bench
(the explain endpoint with body presets).

## Canvas editor

The pipeline editor defaults to a React Flow canvas (`@xyflow/react`,
`apps/web/src/ui/proxy/canvas/`); the node-card form stays available behind
the Canvas/Form toggle and shares the same draft model and per-type field
components (`node-fields.tsx`). One canvas per pipeline — a pipeline is a
function body; call nodes stay collapsed and double-click navigates into the
callee (hash sub-route, browser back works). Canvas semantics:

- Real nodes carry their ports as labeled source handles (condition:
  `true`/`false`; call: one handle per reachable callee exit). Edges derive
  from port refs; dragging a new connection from a handle _replaces_ that
  port's wiring; deleting an edge or node clears the affected ports.
- Targets and jumped-to pipelines appear as terminal pseudo-nodes
  (`ref:target:<id>` / `ref:pipeline:<id>`), created lazily from refs; the
  entry marker is a pseudo-node whose single edge sets `entry`.
- Selecting a node opens the inspector panel (same forms as the card editor);
  port selects there are an alternative to dragging edges.
- Positions persist via the optional per-node `layout {x, y}` field
  (`ApiProxyNodeLayoutSchema`, additive) written on drag stop and saved with
  the pipeline; nodes without `layout` get a layered auto-layout (BFS depth
  from entry). Pseudo-node positions are session-only.
- A test-bench Explain run highlights the traversed path on the canvas: nodes
  and ports of the current pipeline from `routeTrace`, including the caller's
  call-node exit port, which is reconstructed by replaying the trace's
  call/exit nesting (`highlightFromTrace`).

## Validation lifecycle

- **Save time** (`POST/PATCH /api/proxy/pipelines`): full graph validation —
  unique node ids, dangling refs, regex compilation, in-graph DAG,
  cross-pipeline cycle check, callee exit-name check. Errors return as plain
  `{error: string}` 400s.
- **Startup**: `collectApiProxyPipelineGraphWarnings` logs a `pino` warning per
  invalid pipeline loaded from files (the server still starts; affected routes
  fail with diagnostics at request time).
- **Request time**: every structural problem maps to a 503 diagnostic
  (`pipeline_not_found`, `pipeline_disabled`, `pipeline_cycle`,
  `route_unbound`, `route_invalid`) shaped per public protocol.

## Legacy upgrade

Pre-graph records (`steps` + `nodeType` + `routeTo`) are upgraded inside the
core zod schemas (`z.preprocess` on `ApiProxyPipelineRecordSchema` /
`ApiProxyPipelineConfigSchema`): enabled steps become a linear node chain,
`routeTo` becomes the last node's `next` port (or `entry` when there were no
steps). Disabled legacy steps are dropped. The upgrade applies wherever
records are parsed — config files, the one-time SQLite export
(`legacy-migration.ts`) — and rewrites to disk happen on the next mutation.
