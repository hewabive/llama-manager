# llama-manager

Local web control plane for `llama.cpp` and `llama-server`.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Default services:

- API: `http://127.0.0.1:8787`
- Web UI: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

## Runtime logs

Managed `llama-server` launches write two log files:

- `runtime/logs/<instance>-<timestamp>.log`: filtered working log used by the app. Routine local GET/HEAD diagnostics such as `/health`, `/props`, `/slots` and `/v1/models` are omitted to keep agent-readable logs compact.
- `runtime/logs/<instance>-<timestamp>.raw.log`: full stdout/stderr stream with no filtering.

Set `LLAMA_MANAGER_FILTER_PROBE_LOGS=false` to disable filtering of the working log.

## Shutdown

Pressing `Ctrl+C` in the `pnpm dev` terminal sends `SIGINT` to the API. The API closes its HTTP server and then gracefully stops supervised `llama-server` processes. If a child process does not exit before the shutdown timeout, it is force-killed.

Relevant environment variables:

- `LLAMA_MANAGER_STOP_MANAGED_ON_EXIT=false`: leave supervised `llama-server` processes running when the API exits; they will be reconciled as stale on the next API start.
- `LLAMA_MANAGER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS`: graceful stop timeout for managed processes, default `10000`.

## NUMA placement (multi-socket hosts)

On a host with more than one NUMA node, each instance can declare a NUMA policy
(form selector, shown only when >1 node). The Resources page shows the topology
and which GPU hangs off which node.

- **Bind** — confine an instance's CPUs and memory to one node (locality,
  co-tenancy isolation, GPU instances pinned to their card's node). Uses a cgroup
  v2 cpuset, so it needs a one-time `cpuset` delegation, applied as root:

  ```bash
  sudo scripts/setup-numa-cgroup-delegation.sh <user-that-runs-llama-manager>
  ```

  The script writes the `user@.service` `Delegate=cpu cpuset memory pids`
  drop-in, enables linger, and turns `cpuset` on live. Two caveats that bite on
  servers: under linger a plain **logout/login does not activate it** (restart
  `user@<uid>.service` or reboot if the script can't apply it live), and the
  **manager itself must run inside that user session** — one started from an SSH
  shell that lands in `system.slice` cannot pin. Run it as a `systemctl --user`
  service (or `systemd-run --user --scope`). Otherwise a binding is stored but
  not enforced.

- **Interleave** — spread an instance's memory evenly across nodes for full
  aggregate bandwidth (the fast, jitter-free mode for big CPU-resident models).
  Needs only `numactl` on `PATH` — no delegation, no cgroup. Pair it with
  `--numa distribute` in the instance arguments.

No per-node memory budgeting yet — fitting a node's RAM is up to you. See
[docs/NUMA_PINNING.md](docs/NUMA_PINNING.md).

## Public/admin mode

The default route is `/#/status`: a public, redacted diagnostics page. It shows aggregate instance state, RAM usage and sanitized instance names/statuses, but not paths, arguments, logs, PIDs or process details.

Admin routes remain open for local development unless a password is configured:

```bash
LLAMA_MANAGER_ADMIN_PASSWORD='change-me' pnpm dev
```

Relevant API environment variables:

- `LLAMA_MANAGER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: enables admin login with a plain environment password.
- `LLAMA_MANAGER_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`: enables admin login with a `scrypt$...` password hash.
- `LLAMA_MANAGER_AUTH_SECRET`: signs admin session cookies; defaults to the configured password/hash when omitted.
- `LLAMA_MANAGER_SECURE_COOKIE=true`: mark the session cookie secure when served behind HTTPS.
- `LLAMA_MANAGER_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`: admin session lifetime, default `43200`.
